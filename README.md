# ShowdownIO
ShowdownIO is a Python-Selenium-based interface for autonomous battle monitoring and play on Pokémon Showdown. With it, you can automatically participate in or just collect information about battles happening on the world's most popular Pokémon battle simulator. 

The Selenium-based approached embraced by ShowdownIO is just one of many possible ways to implement a Pokémon Showdown API for battling bots. An alternative is the [Socket Battle Bot for Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Synedh/showdown-battle-bot), which relies on the [Pokémon Showdown Battle Protocol](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) to interface with servers. Selenium is arguably clunkier but is favored here for its familiarity to developers and transparency for potential clients.
